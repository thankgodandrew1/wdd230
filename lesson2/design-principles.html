              Based on the information on visual hierarchy found on the Toptal
              Designers web page. The information portrays visual hierarchyas as
              an important part of visual design, its definition is that visual
              hierarchy is the laying out of content in a composition in order
              to effectively communicate information and convey meaning. Visual
              hierarchy is said to direct viewers to the most important
              information first, and then to secondary content. It is
              established through the appropriate use of color, shapes,
              size,alignment, motion, sound, distance, proportion, and
              orientation. the meaning, and mood of a composition is conveyed
              via the creative use of graphic elements that determine the visual
              hierarchy.

            <p>
              Another important part of visual designing or UI is white space
              which is also know as negative space. Its know to be an empty
              space around a content and functional element of a page. This
              let's you design breathe by reducing the amount of text and
              functional elements that users see at once. Its also important to
              know that despite it being called 'white,' this space doesn't need
              to be white, any type of space that serves as a backgroud for the
              content can be considered white space. There are some functional
              elements of white space in visual design or user interface that
              needs to be know: line spacing, padding, letter spacing, and
              margins. This elements makes text more readable and grants that
              attraction to users to a particular object, and white space also
              creates visual hierarchy on a page.

            <p>
              Contrast in web and interface design is considered one of the five
              essential visual design principles. The common ground between
              these principles is that they represent how design elements work
              together to form a visual entity that users perceive and interact
              with. Contrast is the relationship between two or more design
              elements whose dramatic difference are emphasized when both
              element are shown together, when two elements appear to be less
              similar the greater the contrast between them. The most effective
              way to use contrast in web design is by familiarizing yourself
              with the many types of contrast that can exist. Most people might
              think when we talk about contrast, we literally mean color. Yes
              you are right but Its important to know that their are six types
              of contrast, there is color which is the most popular, size,
              space, foreground and background, elements types, and shapes.
